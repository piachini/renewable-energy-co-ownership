# IoT Contract Improvements

## Overview
This PR enhances the IoT contract with improved data management capabilities and robust signature validation. The changes focus on security, efficiency, and maintainability.

## Changes

### Data Management
- Added data retention period (30 days) and maximum storage limit (1000 data points)
- Implemented `cleanOldData` function for efficient data cleanup
- Added `getDataCount` and `getDataInRange` functions for data querying
- Improved data validation with detailed error messages

### Signature Validation
- Enhanced EIP-712 signature validation
- Added comprehensive signature component validation
- Improved error handling for invalid signatures
- Fixed potential security issues in signature recovery

### Performance & Security
- Fixed arithmetic overflow in timestamp handling
- Added unchecked math for gas optimization
- Improved access control for admin functions
- Enhanced event emission for better monitoring

### Testing
- Added comprehensive test suite for data management
- Enhanced signature validation tests
- Added time-based tests for data retention
- Improved test coverage for edge cases

## Testing Done
- All tests passing (116 tests)
- Verified signature validation with valid and invalid cases
- Tested data retention and cleanup functionality
- Verified access control restrictions

## Security Considerations
- EIP-712 compliant signature validation
- Protected against signature replay attacks
- Secure timestamp validation
- Access control for administrative functions

## Breaking Changes
None. All changes are backward compatible.

## Next Steps
- Consider implementing data compression for storage optimization
- Add monitoring for storage usage
- Consider implementing batch operations for data cleanup
